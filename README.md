# IoT Smart Air Pollution Monitor

## Overview
The **IoT Smart Air Pollution Monitor** is a real-time air quality monitoring system powered by Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It measures pollutants like PM2.5, CO2, and other harmful gases and provides users with actionable data to improve their environment and health. The system leverages IoT sensors,  and a user-friendly dashboard for easy monitoring.

## Features
- **Real-time pollution monitoring**: Measures air quality parameters such as CO2, PM2.5, and VOCs.
- **Wireless data transmission**: Sends pollution data to a cloud platform using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
- **User-friendly dashboard**: Displays the collected data and pollution levels on an interactive interface.
- **Alert system**: Sends notifications or alerts when pollution levels exceed safe thresholds.

## Technologies Used
- **IoT Sensors**: To detect pollutants such as PM2.5, CO2, and other gases.
- **Microcontroller**: Typically an ESP8266, Arduino, or ESP32, to process the sensor data.
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Power Supply**: Can be powered via USB or battery, depending on setup.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **Hardware**:
  - IoT sensors (e.g., MQ-135 for gases, PMS5003 for PM2.5).
  - Microcontroller (e.g., ESP8266, ESP32, Arduino).
  - Power supply (battery or USB).
  
- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for uploading code to the microcontroller.

### Steps:
1. **Set up the hardware**: 
   - Connect your sensors (e.g., PM2.5, CO2) to the microcontroller.
   - Ensure the microcontroller is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
  
2. **Upload the code**: 
   - Open the provided code in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
   - Modify the Wi-Fi and cloud credentials in the code.
   - Upload the code to your microcontroller

3. **Power up**: 
   - Connect your IoT device to a power source (USB or battery).
   - The system will begin collecting data and sending it to the cloud.

## Usage
- Once the system is up and running, you can view real-time data on the cloud dashboard.
- Alerts will trigger if air quality exceeds predefined levels.
- Data is continuously sent to the cloud for monitoring and historical analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile app integration**: Develop a mobile app for easier monitoring and alerts.
- **Data analytics**: Integrate machine learning to predict pollution levels and provide recommendations.
- **Additional sensors**: Include additional environmental parameters like humidity, temperature, or noise pollution.
